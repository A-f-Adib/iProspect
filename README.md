<h3> Description:</h3> <br>
In this project i built an app named iProspects, which is used to track who the user meet at conferences. It will track if the user is connected with that person or not. If the user is connected then the person is shown in the connected tab, but if not connected the app send a timer notification to connect with that person. It will show a QR code that stores users attendee information, then others can scan that code to add the user to their list of possible leads for later follow up.

Here i used tab bars and context menus, shared custom data using the environment, sending custom change notifications, and more.

   4. CoreImage.Cifilterbuiltins <br>
   5. CodeScanner <br>
   6. UserNotifications

<h3> What I Learned:</h3> <br>
Here i learned how to work with CodeScanner framework and UserNotifications framework for scan a QR code and send local and server notification to the user. I also learned how i can make an environmentObject so that i can use that object to where ever  in the view i want by controlling the parents property of that object.
